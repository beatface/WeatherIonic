# WeatherIonic

Weather app using Ionic, Express, Node, AngularJS and Weather Underground API, saving user's searches in local storage.

### Purpose
I wrote this app at the beginning of my second semester at [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/) as my first attempt at working with Ionic.

### Features
The app displays a user's local weather by using their geolocation data. Users are then able to make more searches by city name, all stored to local storage, and swipe through to see saved cities.
